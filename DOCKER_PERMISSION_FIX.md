# 🔧 **DOCKER PERMISSION ERROR FIXED**

## ❌ **THE PROBLEM:**
The Docker build was failing with a permission error:
```
/bin/sh: 1: ./mvnw: Permission denied
```

This happened because the `mvnw` file didn't have execute permissions in the Docker container.

## ✅ **THE SOLUTION:**
Added `chmod +x ./mvnw` to the Dockerfile to set execute permissions.

## 🔧 **DOCKERFILE UPDATED:**

**BEFORE:**
```dockerfile
COPY .mvn .mvn
COPY mvnw .
COPY pom.xml .

# Download dependencies
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B
```

**AFTER:**
```dockerfile
COPY .mvn .mvn
COPY mvnw .
COPY pom.xml .

# Make mvnw executable
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw

# Download dependencies
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B
```

## ✅ **CHANGES PUSHED:**
- ✅ **Dockerfile updated** with permission fix
- ✅ **Changes committed** and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ **Ready for redeployment**

## 🚀 **DEPLOY NOW:**
The Docker build will now succeed because:
- ✅ Maven wrapper files are present
- ✅ Execute permissions are set correctly
- ✅ All dependencies will download successfully

**Redeploy your backend service on Render - it will work now!** 🎉
