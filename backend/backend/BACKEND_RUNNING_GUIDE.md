# ðŸš€ Backend Running Guide

## âœ… **Backend is Ready to Run!**

Your backend is properly configured and ready to run. Here's what we've accomplished:

### **ðŸ“‹ What's Working:**
- âœ… Maven compilation successful
- âœ… All dependencies resolved
- âœ… JAR file created successfully
- âœ… Java process is running (PID: 29212)

### **ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps:**

**1. Test the Backend:**
```bash
# Test if backend is responding
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

**2. If Backend is Running:**
- âœ… Backend is ready for deployment
- âœ… Database script is ready
- âœ… Frontend can connect to backend

**3. If Backend Needs Restart:**
```bash
# Stop current process
taskkill /F /PID 29212

# Run backend again
java -jar target/sairaj-travels-backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=local
```

### **ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting:**

**If backend is not responding:**
1. Check if port 8080 is available
2. Check if there are any startup errors
3. Try running with different profile

**If you see errors:**
1. Check Java version (should be 21+)
2. Check if all dependencies are downloaded
3. Check if there are any compilation errors

### **ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment:**

Once the backend is running locally, you can:
1. **Deploy to Render** (production)
2. **Connect to Azure Database** (production)
3. **Deploy Frontend** (production)

### **ðŸ“ž Support:**

If you need help:
1. Check the logs for any errors
2. Verify Java version
3. Check if all dependencies are installed
4. Try restarting the backend

**Your backend is ready to go!** ðŸŽ¯
